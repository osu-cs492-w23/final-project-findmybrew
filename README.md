FindMyBrew allows brewery-lovers to find information on breweries around the world. Users can search for breweries with a simple keyword and learn more about breweries' names, locations, phone numbers, and website URLs. Additionally, users can bookmark their favorite breweries to save the search results for later.

This was the final project for CS 492 (Mobile Application Development) at Oregon State University in March 2023.
